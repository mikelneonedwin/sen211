# SEN 211 - Introduction to Software Engineering Semesterâ€™s Project

## Project Description

The project is to build a personal e-learning application for year one students in the Faculty of Computing. The application must have the following sections:

### Course Modules Section

The course module covers the following courses:

- COS111
- COS121
- MTH111/121
- PHY111/121
- UNIUYO-CSC111
- UNIUYO-CSC112
- UNIUYO-CSC121
- UNIUYO-CSC122

Each course module should provide:

- A quiz section with multiple-choice questions, score tracking, and a timer for the duration of the quiz.
- A learning section with suggested learning materials for the course.

### Student Performance Evaluation and Counselling Section

- Tools and features to evaluate student performance.
- Counselling resources based on student performance.

### Additional Sections

- Any other sections based on expected user requirements.

## Project Groupings

- **Group 1:** COS 111 module
- **Group 2:** COS 121 module
- **Group 3:** MTH 111/121 module
- **Group 4:** PHY 111/121 module
- **Group 5:** UNIUYO-CSC 111 module
- **Group 6:** UNIUYO-CSC 112 module
- **Group 7:** UNIUYO-CSC 121 module
- **Group 8:** UNIUYO-CSC 122 module
- **Group 9:** Student performance evaluation and counselling section
- **Group 10:** Application home page that integrates all other modules/sections

Each group is expected to submit full documentation for the implementation of their project. The documentation should follow standard software engineering processes, including the software process model, system modeling, requirements, and specification.
