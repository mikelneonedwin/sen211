    <h1>Part 4: Waves, Electricity, and Modern Physics</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 22: Wave Motion</h2>
    <p>
        Waves are fundamental to the transmission of energy across various media. A wave is defined as a propagating
        disturbance that moves through a medium, transferring energy and momentum without the transport of matter. Waves
        can be classified into two primary types: transverse and longitudinal. In transverse waves, such as those
        observed on a stretched string, the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave
        propagation. Conversely, longitudinal waves, exemplified by sound waves, involve particle oscillations parallel
        to the direction of propagation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several key characteristics define wave motion. The wavelength, denoted as λ, measures the distance between two
        corresponding points on successive waves, such as crests or troughs. Frequency, represented by f, describes the
        number of wave cycles that occur per second and is measured in hertz (Hz). The period, T, is the reciprocal of
        frequency and represents the time taken for one complete cycle of the wave. The wave speed, v, is related to
        these quantities by the equation v = fλ.
    </p>
    <p>
        A particularly important phenomenon in wave motion is resonance, which occurs when a system vibrates at specific
        frequencies known as natural frequencies. In such cases, the system absorbs energy efficiently, leading to the
        formation of standing waves. These standing waves are characterized by nodes, where no motion occurs, and
        antinodes, where maximum displacement is observed.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 23: Sound</h2>
    <p>
        Sound is a type of longitudinal wave that propagates through a medium such as air, water, or solid materials.
        The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium, including its density and elasticity. For instance,
        sound travels faster in solids than in gases due to the closer arrangement of particles in solids.
    </p>
    <p>
        The intensity of sound quantifies the energy transmitted per unit area per second. This intensity is related to
        our perception of loudness, which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels (dB). Another fascinating
        phenomenon associated with sound is the production of beats, which occur when two waves of slightly different
        frequencies interfere, resulting in alternating patterns of loudness and softness.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Doppler effect describes the apparent change in frequency of a sound wave due to the relative motion between
        the source and the observer. This effect explains why an ambulance siren sounds higher in pitch as it approaches
        and lower as it moves away.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 24: Coulomb's Law and Electric Fields</h2>
    <p>
        Electrostatics explores the behavior of charges at rest. Coulomb's Law provides the foundational equation for
        calculating the force between two point charges. This force is directly proportional to the product of the
        charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The law introduces the Coulomb
        constant, k, and the permittivity of free space, ε₀, which are constants that quantify the medium's effect on
        the interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept of an electric field, defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge at a given point,
        is central to electrostatics. Electric fields are visualized using field lines that originate from positive
        charges and terminate on negative charges. The strength and direction of the field can be determined using the
        principle of superposition, which involves summing the contributions of multiple charges.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 25: Potential and Capacitance</h2>
    <p>
        Electric potential extends the concept of work and energy to the electric field. The potential difference
        between two points is defined as the work done per unit charge in moving a charge from one point to another.
        Absolute potential refers to the potential at a point relative to infinity, providing a useful reference for
        calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Capacitance measures a system's ability to store electric charge. A parallel-plate capacitor, for instance,
        consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material, or dielectric. The capacitance of such a
        system is directly proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to their separation.
        Introducing a dielectric material increases capacitance by reducing the electric field between the plates.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 26: Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law</h2>
    <p>
        Electric current is the rate at which charge flows through a conductor. The direction of conventional current is
        taken as the flow of positive charge, although, in most conductors, electrons are the actual charge carriers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Resistance quantifies a material's opposition to the flow of current. Ohm's Law establishes a linear
        relationship between voltage, current, and resistance, expressed as V = IR. Resistivity, a material property,
        depends on the material's structure and temperature, with most materials exhibiting increased resistance at
        higher temperatures.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 27: Electrical Power</h2>
    <p>
        Electrical power represents the rate at which energy is transferred or converted in an electrical circuit. It is
        calculated as the product of voltage and current, P = VI. In resistive elements, power dissipation results in
        heat generation, which is described by the formula P = I²R.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 28: Equivalent Resistance and Simple Circuits</h2>
    <p>
        Simplifying circuits involves calculating the equivalent resistance of components. In series connections,
        resistances add directly, while in parallel connections, the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of
        the reciprocals of individual resistances. These simplifications form the basis for analyzing complex networks.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 29: Kirchhoff's Laws</h2>
    <p>
        Kirchhoff's laws are essential tools for analyzing circuits. The junction rule states that the sum of currents
        entering a junction equals the sum of currents leaving, reflecting charge conservation. The loop rule asserts
        that the sum of potential differences around any closed loop in a circuit is zero, a consequence of energy
        conservation.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 30: Forces in Magnetic Fields</h2>
    <p>
        Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges and current-carrying conductors. The Lorentz force describes the
        interaction between a charge's motion and a magnetic field, with the force's direction determined by the
        right-hand rule. Current-carrying wires in magnetic fields experience a force proportional to the current, field
        strength, and the length of the wire within the field.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 31: Sources of Magnetic Fields</h2>
    <p>
        Magnetic fields arise from moving charges. A long, straight current-carrying wire produces a circular magnetic
        field around it, with the field's direction given by the right-hand rule. Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron,
        amplify magnetic fields due to their high permeability, making them essential in applications like transformers
        and motors.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 32: Induced EMF and Magnetic Flux</h2>
    <p>
        Faraday's Law explains how a changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit. Lenz's
        Law complements this by stating that the induced EMF opposes the change in flux, ensuring energy conservation.
        This principle underlies technologies such as electric generators and transformers.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 33: Electric Generators and Motors</h2>
    <p>
        Electric generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction.
        Conversely, electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy by utilizing the force exerted on
        current-carrying conductors in magnetic fields.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 34: Self-Inductance and Time Constants</h2>
    <p>
        Inductors resist changes in current by inducing an opposing EMF. The energy stored in an inductor's magnetic
        field is proportional to the square of the current. Time constants characterize the response of R-C and R-L
        circuits to changes, governing the rates of charging, discharging, or current adjustment.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 35: Alternating Current</h2>
    <p>
        Alternating current (AC) circuits involve currents and voltages that vary sinusoidally with time. Impedance
        generalizes resistance to include effects from inductors and capacitors, while resonance occurs at frequencies
        where inductive and capacitive reactances cancel, maximizing current flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 36: Reflection of Light</h2>
    <p>
        Reflection involves light bouncing off surfaces. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, a
        principle applied in designing mirrors. Plane mirrors produce virtual images, while spherical mirrors, depending
        on their shape, form real or virtual images.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 37: Refraction of Light</h2>
    <p>
        Refraction occurs when light passes between media of different densities, bending due to a change in speed.
        Snell's Law quantifies this bending. Total internal reflection, a phenomenon critical in fiber optics, occurs
        when light reflects entirely within a medium.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 38: Thin Lenses</h2>
    <p>
        Thin lenses focus or disperse light to form images. The focal length depends on the lens's curvature and
        refractive index. Lens combinations are used in optical devices like microscopes and telescopes.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 39: Optical Instruments</h2>
    <p>
        Optical instruments like magnifying glasses, microscopes, and telescopes extend human vision. They rely on
        combinations of lenses and mirrors to magnify objects or observe distant celestial bodies.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 40: Interference and Diffraction</h2>
    <p>
        Light waves exhibit interference when they overlap, producing patterns of constructive and destructive
        interference. Diffraction occurs when waves bend around obstacles, a phenomenon crucial in understanding limits
        of resolution in optical systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 41: Relativity</h2>
    <p>
        Einstein's theory of special relativity revolutionized physics by introducing concepts such as time dilation,
        length contraction, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²). These effects become significant at speeds
        approaching the speed of light.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 42: Quantum Physics and Wave Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
        Quantum physics reveals the dual wave-particle nature of matter and light. Phenomena like the photoelectric
        effect and Compton scattering illustrate the quantized nature of energy and momentum. The de Broglie hypothesis
        extends wave-like behavior to particles.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 43: The Hydrogen Atom</h2>
    <p>
        The hydrogen atom, with its single electron, serves as a model system for quantum mechanics. Bohr's model
        quantifies energy levels, explaining spectral lines and photon emission during electronic transitions.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 44: Multielectron Atoms</h2>
    <p>
        Multielectron atoms introduce complexities like electron-electron interactions and spin-orbit coupling. Quantum
        numbers and the Pauli exclusion principle govern the arrangement of electrons in atomic orbitals.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 45: Nuclei and Radioactivity</h2>
    <p>
        Atomic nuclei consist of protons and neutrons held together by the strong nuclear force. Unstable nuclei undergo
        radioactive decay, emitting particles and energy. This process is characterized by the half-life, a measure of
        the decay rate.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 46: Applied Nuclear Physics</h2>
    <p>
        Nuclear physics has practical applications in energy production through fission and fusion. Accelerators enable
        the study of high-energy particle interactions, while medical imaging and radiation therapy utilize nuclear
        technologies to diagnose and treat diseases.
