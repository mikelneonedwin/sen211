  <h1>Part 3: Fluid Dynamics and Thermodynamics</h1>

  <h2><u>Fluids at Rest</u></h2>

  <h3>Average Pressure</h3>
  <p>The average pressure on a surface of area <i>A</i> is found as force divided by area, where it is stipulated that
    the force must be perpendicular (normal) to the area:</p>
  <p>Average pressure = <ins>force acting normal to an area / area over which the force is distributed</ins></p>
  <p>Recall that the SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa). 1 Pa = 1 N/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <h3>Standard Atmospheric Pressure</h3>
  <p>1 atmosphere (atm) ≈ 1.01 x 10<sup>5</sup> Pa; this is equivalent to 14.7 lb/in<sup>2</sup>.</p>
  <p>Other units used for pressure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 torr = 1 mm of mercury (mm Hg) ≈ 133.3 Pa</li>
    <li>1 bar = 10<sup>5</sup> Pa</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Hydrostatic Pressure</h3>
  <p>Hydrostatic pressure due to a column of fluid of height <i>h</i> and mass density <i>ρ</i> is:</p>
  <p>P = ρgh</p>

  <h3>Pascal's Principle</h3>
  <p>When the pressure on any part of a confined fluid (liquid or gas) is changed, the pressure on every other part of
    the fluid is also changed by the same amount.</p>

  <h3>Archimedes' Principle</h3>
  <p>A body wholly or partly immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. The
    buoyant force can be considered to act vertically upward through the center of gravity of the displaced fluid.</p>


  <h2><u>Fluids in Motion</u></h2>

  <h3>Fluid Flow or Discharge</h3>
  <p>When a fluid (like oil) flows through a pipe, the fluid flow or discharge rate is:</p>
  <p><i>J</i> = <i>Av</i></p>
  <p>where <i>A</i> is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.</p>

  <h3>Equation of Continuity</h3>
  <p>Suppose that an incompressible (constant-density) fluid fills a pipe and flows through it. Suppose further that the
    cross-sectional areas are <i>A<sub>1</sub></i> at one point and <i>A<sub>2</sub></i> at another. Since the fluid
    flow must equal the flow through <i>A<sub>2</sub></i>, one has:</p>
  <p><i>A<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> = A<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub></i> (constant)</p>

  <h3>Shear Rate</h3>
  <p>The shear rate is the rate at which the shear strain within the fluid is changing. Because shear has no units, the
    SI unit for shear rate is s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

  <h3>Viscosity</h3>
  <p>Viscosity (η) is a measure of how large a shear stress is required to produce a unit shear rate. Its SI unit is
    that of stress per unit shear rate, or Pa · s.</p>

  <h3>Poiseuille's Law</h3>
  <p>The fluid flow through a cylindrical pipe of length <i>L</i> and cross-sectional radius <i>r</i> is given by:</p>
  <p><i>J</i> = (πr<sup>4</sup>/8ηL)(P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>2</sub>)</p>

  <h3>Work Done by a Piston</h3>
  <p>The work done by a piston in forcing a volume <i>V</i> of fluid into a cylinder against an opposing pressure
    <i>P</i> is given by <i>PV</i>.</p>

  <h3>Work Done by a Moving Surface</h3>
  <p>The work done on a surface of area <i>A</i> as the surface moves through a distance <i>Δx</i> normal to the surface
    (thereby displacing a volume <i>A Δx</i>) is:</p>
  <p>Work = <i>P(A Δx) = PΔV</i></p>


  <h3>Bernoulli's Equation</h3>
  <p>Let fluid flow at a height <i>h<sub>1</sub></i> and let <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>1</sub></i> be the fluid
    speed and pressure at that point. Similarly define <i>h<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>, and
    <i>P<sub>2</sub></i> for point 2. Then, provided the fluid is incompressible and has negligible viscosity:</p>
  <p>P<sub>1</sub> + ρgh<sub>1</sub> + ½ρv<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = P<sub>2</sub> + ρgh<sub>2</sub> +
    ½ρv<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></p>


  <h3>Torricelli's Theorem</h3>
  <p>Suppose that a tank contains liquid and is open to the atmosphere at its top. If an orifice (opening) exists in the
    tank at a distance <i>h</i> below the top of the liquid, then the speed of flow from the orifice to the free liquid
    below the top is:</p>
  <p>v ≈ √(2gh)</p>


  <h3>Reynolds Number</h3>
  <p>The Reynolds number is a dimensionless number that applies to a fluid of viscosity η and density ρ flowing with
    speed <i>v</i> through a pipe or past an obstacle with diameter <i>D</i>:</p>
  <p><i>R = ρvD/η</i></p>


  <h2><u>Thermodynamics</u></h2>

  <h3>Heat</h3>
  <p>Heat (ΔQ) is the thermal energy that flows from one body or system to another, which is in thermal equilibrium with
    its surroundings. Heat always flows from hot to cold.</p>

  <h3>Internal Energy</h3>
  <p>The internal energy (ΔU) of a system is the total energy content of the system. It is the sum of all forms of
    energy possessed by the atoms and molecules of the system.</p>

  <h3>Work Done by a System</h3>
  <p>When a system expands doing work on the surroundings at a constant pressure P, the work done is given by:</p>
  <p>ΔW = PΔV</p>


  <h3>First Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
  <p>The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the law of conservation of energy. It states that if an amount of
    heat ΔQ flows into or out of a system, then this energy must appear as changed internal energy ΔU of the system
    and/or as work done by the system on its surroundings:</p>
  <p>ΔQ = ΔU + ΔW</p>


  <h3>Isobaric Process</h3>
  <p>An isobaric process is a process carried out at constant pressure.</p>

  <h3>Isovolumetric Process</h3>
  <p>An isovolumetric process is a process carried out at constant volume.</p>

  <h3>Isothermal Process</h3>
  <p>An isothermal process is a process carried out at constant temperature. However, this is true for many systems only
    approximately.</p>

  <h3>Adiabatic Process</h3>
  <p>An adiabatic process is one in which no heat is transferred to or from the system. For such a process, ΔQ = 0.</p>

  <h3>Specific Heats of Gases</h3>
  <p>When a gas is heated at constant volume, the heat supplied increases only the internal energy of the molecules; the
    energy of the molecules does not do mechanical work in expanding the gas against the opposing pressure.</p>

  <h3>Specific Heat Ratio</h3>
  <p>The specific heat ratio indicates that for monatomic gases such as He, Ne, A, etc., this ratio is greater than
    unity.</p>

  <h3>Work Related to Area</h3>
  <p>The work done by a fluid in an expansion is equal to the area beneath the expansion curve on a p-V diagram.</p>

  <h3>Efficiency of a Heat Engine</h3>
  <p>The Carnot cycle is the most efficient possible cycle for a heat engine.</p>

  <h3>Entropy and the Second Law</h3>
  <p>The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in three equivalent ways.</p>
