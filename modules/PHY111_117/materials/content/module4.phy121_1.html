        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This section covers the fundamental concepts of vectors, fields, and the basics of electric charge.
            These concepts form the building blocks for understanding more complex topics in electricity
            and magnetism.
        </p>

        <h2>Vectors</h2>
        <p>
            A vector is a mathematical entity characterized by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Magnitude (length or size).</li>
            <li>Direction.</li>
            <li>Obeys addition rules like the parallelogram rule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Scalars, in contrast, only have magnitude. Examples include mass, energy, and electric charge.
        </p>

        <h3>Vector Operations</h3>
        <h4>Addition of Vectors</h4>
        <p>
            Two vectors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> can be added graphically using the parallelogram rule or
            component-wise:
        </p>
        <p>
            C<sub>x</sub> = A<sub>x</sub> + B<sub>x</sub>, C<sub>y</sub> = A<sub>y</sub> + B<sub>y</sub>
        </p>

        <h4>Dot Product (Scalar Product)</h4>
        <p>
            The dot product of two vectors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
            A · B = |A||B|cos(θ)
        </p>
        <p>
            It is used to find work done, where the force and displacement are vectors.
        </p>

        <h4>Cross Product (Vector Product)</h4>
        <p>
            The cross product of two vectors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> gives a vector <em>C</em>:
        </p>
        <p>
            C = |A||B|sin(θ)
        </p>
        <p>
            The direction of <em>C</em> is determined by the right-hand rule.
        </p>

        <h3>Applications of Vectors</h3>
        <p>
            Vectors are fundamental in physics and are used to describe quantities such as displacement, velocity, and
            force. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Represents the shortest path between two points.</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> Describes the rate of change of displacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Force:</strong> Combines magnitude and direction to show the effect of interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fields</h2>
        <p>
            Fields describe quantities distributed over space. These can be scalar fields (e.g., temperature)
            or vector fields (e.g., electric fields).
        </p>

        <h3>Representation of Fields</h3>
        <p>
            Vector fields are represented using field lines:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The tangent to a field line indicates the direction of the field.</li>
            <li>The density of field lines represents the magnitude of the field.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Examples of Fields</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gravitational Field:</strong> Affects objects with mass.</li>
            <li><strong>Electric Field:</strong> Affects objects with charge.</li>
            <li><strong>Magnetic Field:</strong> Affects moving charges and magnetic materials.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Electric Charge</h2>
        <p>
            Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. It comes in two types: positive and negative.
        </p>

        <h3>Properties of Electric Charge</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quantization:</strong> Charge exists in discrete amounts, multiples of the elementary charge
                (e).</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The total charge in a closed system remains constant.</li>
            <li><strong>Attraction and Repulsion:</strong> Like charges repel; unlike charges attract.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
        <p>
            The force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law:
        </p>
        <p>
            F = k * (q<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub>) / r<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>k</em> is Coulomb's constant.</li>
            <li><em>q<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>q<sub>2</sub></em> are the charges.</li>
            <li><em>r</em> is the distance between the charges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Superposition Principle</h3>
        <p>
            The net force or field due to multiple charges is the vector sum of individual contributions:
        </p>
        <p>
            F<sub>net</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> + F<sub>2</sub> + ...
        </p>

        <h3>Advanced Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Charge Distribution:</strong> Continuous charge distributions require integration to calculate
                fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Polarization:</strong> The effect of an external field on charge distribution within materials.
            </li>
        </ul>
