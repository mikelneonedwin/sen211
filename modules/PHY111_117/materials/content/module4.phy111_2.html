    <h1>Part 2: Equilibrium and Energy</h1>

    <h2>Equilibrium Under the Action of Concurrent Forces</h2>
    <p>This chapter focuses on systems where all forces acting on an object pass through a single point (concurrent
        forces). The key concept is that an object is in equilibrium when the <u>vector sum</u> of all forces acting on
        it is zero. This leads to two conditions for equilibrium:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The First Condition for Equilibrium:</strong> ΣF<sub>x</sub> = 0 and ΣF<sub>y</sub> = 0. (The sum of
            the x-components and y-components of all forces must be zero).</li>
        <li>This condition is sufficient for equilibrium if the forces are concurrent. For non-concurrent forces, we
            need the second condition as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The chapter provides a systematic problem-solving method:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Isolate the object for discussion.</li>
        <li>Show the forces acting on the isolated object in a diagram (free-body diagram).</li>
        <li>Find the rectangular components of each force.</li>
        <li>Write the first condition for equilibrium in equation form.</li>
        <li>Solve for the required quantities.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Specific types of forces are discussed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Weight of an object (F<sub>w</sub>):</em> The force of gravity pulling downward.</li>
        <li><em>Tensile force (F<sub>T</sub>):</em> The force in a string, cable, or tendon.</li>
        <li><em>Friction force (F<sub>f</sub>):</em> A force opposing the sliding of one surface across another. The
            chapter introduces both static and kinetic friction, and defines the coefficient of friction (μ).</li>
        <li><em>Normal force (F<sub>N</sub>):</em> The component of the supporting force that is perpendicular to the
            surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The concept of dimensional analysis is also introduced as a way to check the validity of equations and ensure
        consistency of units.</p>


    <h2>Equilibrium of a Rigid Body Under Coplanar Forces</h2>
    <p>This chapter extends the equilibrium concepts to rigid bodies subjected to forces that lie in a single plane
        (coplanar forces). A new concept, <u>torque</u> (or moment), is introduced. Torque is the measure of the
        effectiveness of a force in producing rotation around an axis. It's defined as:</p>
    <p>Torque = rF sin θ</p>
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>r is the radial distance from the axis to the point of application of the force.</li>
        <li>F is the magnitude of the force.</li>
        <li>θ is the angle between the line of action of F and the line from the axis to the point where F is applied.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two conditions are necessary for equilibrium of a rigid body under coplanar forces:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The First (or Force) Condition:</strong> The vector sum of all forces acting on the body must be
            zero: Σ<strong>F</strong> = 0</li>
        <li><strong>The Second (or Torque) Condition:</strong> The sum of all torques acting on the body about any axis
            must be zero: Στ = 0</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The chapter introduces the <u>center of gravity</u> as the point at which the entire weight of the object may be
        considered concentrated. The concept of <u>choosing an axis</u> for calculating torque is also discussed to
        simplify calculations.</p>

    <h2>Work, Energy, and Power</h2>
    <p>This chapter delves into the concepts of work, energy, and power. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Work</em> done by a force is defined as the product of the force and the parallel distance over which it
            acts. The formula is: W = F<sub>||</sub>s = Fs cos θ, where θ is the angle between the force and the
            displacement vector.</li>
        <li><em>Energy</em> is the capacity of a system to do work. The chapter focuses on:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Kinetic energy (KE):</u> The energy possessed by an object because it is in motion. KE =
                (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li><u>Potential energy (PE):</u> The energy possessed by an object because of its position or
                configuration. The chapter discusses gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh) and elastic potential
                energy (PE = (1/2)kx<sup>2</sup> for a spring).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><u>Work-energy theorem</u>: states that the net work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic
            energy.</li>
        <li><em>Conservation of energy</em>: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to
            another. This principle is a cornerstone of physics.</li>
        <li><em>Power</em> is the time rate of doing work. Average power is given by: P = W/t = Fv cos θ</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The chapter uses numerous solved problems illustrating the application of these concepts, including calculations
        involving inclined planes and various types of forces.</p>

    <h2>Simple Machines</h2>
    <p>This chapter introduces simple machines and their applications. Simple machines are devices that can change the
        magnitude, direction, or method of application of a force.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Principle of Work</u>: For a simple machine, the work done by the input force equals the work done on the
            load.</li>
        <li><u>Mechanical Advantage (MA)</u>: The ratio of the force exerted by the machine on a load to the force used
            to operate the machine. The chapter distinguishes between <u>actual mechanical advantage (AMA)</u> and
            <u>ideal mechanical advantage (IMA)</u>.</li>
        <li><u>Efficiency</u>: The ratio of output work to input work. It accounts for energy losses due to friction.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Solved problems cover levers, pulleys, wheel and axle, inclined planes, and jacks, showing how to calculate MA,
        AMA, IMA, and efficiency for various scenarios.</p>
