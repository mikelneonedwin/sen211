        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This section explores the concept of electrostatic potential, its relation to electric fields, and the
            unique properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. It also delves into the nature of potential
            energy in an electric field, the mathematical relationships between potential and field strength, and the
            energy storage mechanisms in capacitors. The insights gained here are fundamental to understanding
            electrostatics in physics and engineering.
        </p>

        <h2>Electrostatic Potential</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Electrostatic potential, or simply potential, is the potential energy per unit charge at a point in an
            electric field. It represents the work needed to move a unit positive charge from a reference point (usually
            infinity) to a specific point in the field without any acceleration. Mathematically, it is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
            V = U / q
        </p>
        <p>
            where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>V</em> is the potential (volts).</li>
            <li><em>U</em> is the potential energy (joules).</li>
            <li><em>q</em> is the charge (coulombs).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Work and Potential</h3>
        <p>
            The work done by an electric field in moving a charge from point A to point B is determined by the
            difference in potential between these points. It is expressed as:
        </p>
        <p>
            W = -q (V<sub>B</sub> - V<sub>A</sub>)
        </p>
        <p>
            This relationship shows that the electric field does work to reduce the potential energy of a positive
            charge as it moves along the direction of the field.
        </p>

        <h3>Potential Due to Various Charge Distributions</h3>
        <p>
            The potential at a point due to different types of charge distributions is calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Point Charge:</strong> The potential at a distance <em>r</em> from a point charge <em>q</em> is
                given by:
                <p>V = k * q / r</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Line Charge:</strong> For a uniformly charged line, the potential at a point is calculated by
                integrating the contributions of infinitesimal charge elements along the line.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Surface Charge:</strong> For a charged surface, the potential is found by summing (integrating)
                the effects of charge elements over the entire surface area.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relation Between Potential and Electric Field</h3>
        <p>
            The electric field is the spatial rate of change of the potential. This relationship is expressed
            mathematically as:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = -∇V
        </p>
        <p>
            In Cartesian coordinates, the field components are given by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>E<sub>x</sub> = -∂V / ∂x</li>
            <li>E<sub>y</sub> = -∂V / ∂y</li>
            <li>E<sub>z</sub> = -∂V / ∂z</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This relationship highlights that the electric field points in the direction of maximum decrease in
            potential.
        </p>

        <h2>Conductors in Electrostatics</h2>
        <h3>Properties of Conductors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero Electric Field Inside:</strong> In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a
                conductor is zero. Any excess charge resides on the surface of the conductor.</li>
            <li><strong>Constant Potential:</strong> The entire conductor, including its surface, is an equipotential.
                This means the potential is the same at every point within and on the conductor.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface Charge Distribution:</strong> On irregularly shaped conductors, the surface charge
                density is higher at regions with smaller radii of curvature (sharp points).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Electric Field Just Outside a Conductor</h3>
        <p>
            The electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surface. Its magnitude is
            related to the surface charge density <em>σ</em> as:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = σ / ε<sub>0</sub>
        </p>

        <h3>Shielding Effect</h3>
        <p>
            A conductor shields its interior from external electric fields. This phenomenon, known as electrostatic
            shielding, occurs because the charges within the conductor rearrange themselves to cancel any external field
            inside.
        </p>

        <h3>Capacitors and Energy Storage</h3>
        <p>
            Capacitors are devices designed to store electric energy. They consist of two conductors separated by an
            insulating material (dielectric). When a potential difference is applied, charges accumulate on the plates,
            creating an electric field in the dielectric.
        </p>
        <p>
            The capacitance, a measure of a capacitor's ability to store charge, is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
            C = Q / V
        </p>
        <p>
            The energy stored in a capacitor is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
            U = 1/2 * C * V<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            This energy is stored in the electric field between the plates.
        </p>

        <h3>Dielectric Effect</h3>
        <p>
            The presence of a dielectric material between the plates of a capacitor increases its capacitance. This
            occurs because the dielectric reduces the electric field within the capacitor, allowing more charge to be
            stored for the same potential difference. The capacitance with a dielectric is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
            C = κ * C<sub>0</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>κ</em> is the dielectric constant of the material.</li>
            <li><em>C<sub>0</sub></em> is the capacitance without the dielectric.</li>
        </ul>
