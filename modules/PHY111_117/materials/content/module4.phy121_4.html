        <h2>Capacitance</h2>
        <h3>Definition and Units</h3>
        <p>
            Capacitance is the ability of a system to store electric charge. It is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
            C = Q / V
        </p>
        <p>
            where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>C</em> is the capacitance in farads (F).</li>
            <li><em>Q</em> is the charge stored in coulombs (C).</li>
            <li><em>V</em> is the potential difference in volts (V).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Capacitors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parallel-Plate Capacitor:</strong> Consists of two parallel conductive plates separated by a
                dielectric. The capacitance is given by:
                <p>
                    C = ε<sub>0</sub> * κ * A / d
                </p>
                <p>
                    where:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>ε<sub>0</sub></em> is the permittivity of free space.</li>
                    <li><em>κ</em> is the dielectric constant.</li>
                    <li><em>A</em> is the area of the plates.</li>
                    <li><em>d</em> is the separation between the plates.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Spherical Capacitor:</strong> Consists of two concentric spherical shells. The capacitance is:
                <p>
                    C = 4π * ε<sub>0</sub> * (r<sub>1</sub> * r<sub>2</sub>) / (r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    where <em>r<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>r<sub>2</sub></em> are the radii of the inner and outer
                    spheres.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cylindrical Capacitor:</strong> Formed by two coaxial cylinders. The capacitance is:
                <p>
                    C = 2π * ε<sub>0</sub> * L / ln(r<sub>2</sub> / r<sub>1</sub>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    where <em>L</em> is the length of the cylinders and <em>r<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>r<sub>2</sub></em>
                    are the radii of the inner and outer cylinders.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Energy Stored in a Capacitor</h3>
        <p>
            The energy stored in a charged capacitor is:
        </p>
        <p>
            U = 1/2 * C * V<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            This energy is stored in the electric field between the plates.
        </p>

        <h3>Effect of Dielectrics</h3>
        <p>
            Dielectrics are insulating materials that, when placed between the plates of a capacitor, increase its
            capacitance. The dielectric constant <em>κ</em> measures this effect:
        </p>
        <p>
            C = κ * C<sub>0</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            where <em>C<sub>0</sub></em> is the capacitance without the dielectric.
        </p>

        <h2>Electrical Circuits</h2>
        <h3>Series and Parallel Capacitors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Series:</strong> The total capacitance is given by:
                <p>
                    1 / C<sub>total</sub> = 1 / C<sub>1</sub> + 1 / C<sub>2</sub> + ...
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Parallel:</strong> The total capacitance is:
                <p>
                    C<sub>total</sub> = C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> + ...
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>RC Circuits</h3>
        <p>
            An RC circuit consists of a resistor and a capacitor. The charging and discharging of the capacitor follow
            exponential behavior:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Charging:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Q(t) = Q<sub>max</sub> * (1 - e<sup>-t / RC</sup>)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Discharging:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Q(t) = Q<sub>0</sub> * e<sup>-t / RC</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            where <em>R</em> is the resistance and <em>C</em> is the capacitance.
        </p>

        <h2>Material Properties in Electric Fields</h2>
        <h3>Conductors</h3>
        <p>
            Conductors allow free movement of charge. In an electric field, charges redistribute to cancel the field
            inside the conductor. The surface of a conductor in equilibrium is an equipotential.
        </p>

        <h3>Insulators</h3>
        <p>
            Insulators resist the flow of charge. When placed in an electric field, their molecules polarize, creating
            an induced field that opposes the external field.
        </p>

        <h3>Semiconductors</h3>
        <p>
            Semiconductors have properties between conductors and insulators. Their conductivity can be manipulated by
            doping and is essential in modern electronics.
        </p>

        <h3>Polarization</h3>
        <p>
            Polarization occurs when an electric field causes a separation of charges within a material. This effect
            enhances the material's ability to store energy and is characterized by the polarization vector <em>P</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Capacitance and materials in electric fields have widespread applications in:
        </p>
        <ul>
