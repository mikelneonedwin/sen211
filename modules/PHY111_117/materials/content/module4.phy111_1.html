    <h1>Part 1: Foundational Mechanics</h1>

    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>This section lays the groundwork for the entire book by introducing fundamental concepts in mechanics. We'll
        start with essential mathematical tools and then move on to core principles of motion and forces.</p>

    <h2><u>1. Introduction to Vectors</u></h2>
    <h3><u>Scalar and Vector Quantities</u></h3>
    <p>Physics utilizes both <i>scalar</i> and <i>vector</i> quantities. A <b>scalar</b> quantity, like temperature or
        mass, is fully described by its magnitude. A <b>vector</b> quantity, such as displacement or force, requires
        both magnitude and direction. Vectors are graphically represented by arrows, where the length corresponds to the
        magnitude and the arrowhead points in the direction. </p>

    <h3><u>Vector Addition</u></h3>
    <p>Vectors are added using either the <i>graphical method</i> (placing vectors head-to-tail and drawing the
        resultant) or the <i>parallelogram method</i> (forming a parallelogram with the vectors as adjacent sides; the
        diagonal represents the resultant). The <i>component method</i> involves resolving vectors into their x and y
        (and possibly z) components, adding the components separately, and then finding the magnitude and direction of
        the resultant vector.</p>
    <p><u>Example</u>: Two displacement vectors, 20 m at 40° and 40 m at 137°, can be added graphically or using the
        component method to find the resultant displacement. </p>

    <h3><u>Vector Subtraction</u></h3>
    <p>Subtracting vector <strong>B</strong> from vector <strong>A</strong> is equivalent to adding the negative of
        <strong>B</strong> (same magnitude, opposite direction) to <strong>A</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Unit Vectors</u></h3>
    <p>Unit vectors (<b>î</b>, <b>ĵ</b>, <b>k̂</b>) have a magnitude of one and point along the x, y, and z axes
        respectively. They provide a convenient way to express vectors in component form.</p>

    <h3><u>Solved Problems</u></h3>
    <p>The chapter includes many solved problems illustrating various vector operations, including graphical addition,
        the parallelogram method, and the component method, along with applications to relative velocity and other
        physical scenarios.</p>


    <h2><u>2. Uniformly Accelerated Motion</u></h2>
    <h3><u>Speed and Velocity</u></h3>
    <p><b>Speed</b> is a scalar quantity (distance/time). <b>Velocity</b> is a vector quantity (displacement/time),
        possessing both magnitude and direction. Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific instant, while
        average velocity is the overall displacement divided by the total time.</p>

    <h3><u>Acceleration</u></h3>
    <p><b>Acceleration</b> is the rate of change of velocity (vector quantity). It's calculated as the change in
        velocity divided by the time interval. Uniformly accelerated motion along a straight line is a key concept,
        described by five equations relating displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time.</p>

    <h3><u>Acceleration Due to Gravity</u></h3>
    <p>The acceleration due to gravity (<b>g</b>) is approximately 9.81 m/s² directed vertically downward. This constant
        acceleration plays a crucial role in projectile motion problems.</p>

    <h3><u>Velocity Components</u></h3>
    <p>For projectile motion (motion under gravity), velocities are resolved into horizontal and vertical components.
        The equations of uniformly accelerated motion are applied separately to each component to solve for various
        aspects of the trajectory.</p>

    <h3><u>Projectile Motion</u></h3>
    <p>Projectile motion combines horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (uniformly accelerated) motion. Solved
        problems in this section demonstrate how to determine range, maximum height, time of flight, and other
        parameters of projectile trajectories.</p>
    <h3><u>Solved Problems</u></h3>
    <p>Numerous solved problems cover topics such as calculating average speed, determining instantaneous velocity from
        distance-time graphs, analyzing projectile motion in detail, and investigating various one-dimensional motion
        scenarios.</p>


    <h2><u>3. Newton's Laws</u></h2>
    <h3><u>Mass and Force</u></h3>
    <p><b>Mass</b> is a measure of an object's inertia (resistance to change in motion). The standard kilogram is the
        fundamental unit of mass. <b>Force</b> is the agent of change in motion, a vector quantity possessing magnitude
        and direction. Newton's second law (F=ma) quantifies this relationship: force equals mass times acceleration.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Newton's Three Laws</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Newton's First Law (Inertia):</b> An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in
            motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.</li>
        <li><b>Newton's Second Law:</b> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting
            on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F=ma). </li>
        <li><b>Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction):</b> For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
            Forces always occur in pairs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><u>Weight</u></h3>
    <p><b>Weight</b> is the gravitational force acting on an object. On Earth, it's approximately mg, where m is the
        mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Weight is a force, thus it's a vector.</p>

    <h3><u>Other Forces</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tension:</b> Force in a rope or string.</li>
        <li><b>Friction:</b> Force opposing motion between surfaces.</li>
        <li><b>Normal Force:</b> Force perpendicular to a supporting surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Coefficients of static and kinetic friction are introduced and used in problem-solving.</p>

    <h3><u>Dimensional Analysis</u></h3>
    <p>Dimensional analysis, checking the consistency of units in equations, is explained, serving as a valuable tool
        for error checking and problem-solving.</p>

    <h3><u>Solved Problems</u></h3>
    <p>The chapter offers a wide range of solved problems dealing with applications of Newton's laws, including
        calculating weight, resolving forces into components, analyzing systems with friction, applying dimensional
        analysis, and examining various force scenarios (e.g., Atwood machines, inclined planes).</p>
