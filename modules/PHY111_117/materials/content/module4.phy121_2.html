        <h1>Part 2: Electric Fields and Gauss's Theorem</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This section delves into the concept of electric fields and the fundamental principles of Gauss's Theorem.
            We explore the behavior of electric fields due to various charge distributions and apply Gauss's Theorem to
            solve complex problems with symmetry.
        </p>

        <h2>Electric Fields</h2>
        <h3>Definition and Properties</h3>
        <p>
            An electric field is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge exerted on a test charge at a
            given point in space. It is defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = F / q
        </p>
        <p>
            where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>E</em> is the electric field (N/C).</li>
            <li><em>F</em> is the force experienced by the test charge (N).</li>
            <li><em>q</em> is the magnitude of the test charge (C).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Field Lines</h3>
        <p>
            Electric field lines provide a visual representation of the field:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lines point away from positive charges and toward negative charges.</li>
            <li>The density of lines indicates the strength of the field.</li>
            <li>Field lines never intersect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Electric Field Due to a Point Charge</h3>
        <p>
            The electric field due to a single point charge <em>q</em> at a distance <em>r</em> is given by:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = k * q / r<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>k</em> is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10<sup>9</sup> N·m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup>).</li>
            <li><em>q</em> is the charge.</li>
            <li><em>r</em> is the distance from the charge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Superposition Principle</h3>
        <p>
            For multiple charges, the net electric field at a point is the vector sum of fields due to individual
            charges:
        </p>
        <p>
            E<sub>net</sub> = E<sub>1</sub> + E<sub>2</sub> + ...
        </p>

        <h3>Field Due to Continuous Charge Distributions</h3>
        <p>
            For continuous charge distributions, the field is calculated by integrating over the charge distribution:
        </p>
        <p>
            dE = k * dq / r<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of continuous distributions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear Charge Density (λ):</strong> dq = λ dx</li>
            <li><strong>Surface Charge Density (σ):</strong> dq = σ dA</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Charge Density (ρ):</strong> dq = ρ dV</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gauss's Theorem</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Gauss's Theorem relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by that surface:
        </p>
        <p>
            Φ = ∮ E · dA = Q<sub>enc</sub> / ε<sub>0</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Φ</em> is the electric flux.</li>
            <li><em>E</em> is the electric field.</li>
            <li><em>dA</em> is the infinitesimal area element.</li>
            <li><em>Q<sub>enc</sub></em> is the enclosed charge.</li>
            <li><em>ε<sub>0</sub></em> is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10<sup>-12</sup>
                C<sup>2</sup>/N·m<sup>2</sup>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of Gauss's Theorem</h3>
        <p>
            Gauss's Theorem is particularly useful for calculating electric fields in cases with high symmetry:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Spherical Symmetry</h4>
        <p>
            For a point charge or a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field is:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = Q / (4π ε<sub>0</sub> r<sup>2</sup>)
        </p>

        <h4>2. Cylindrical Symmetry</h4>
        <p>
            For an infinitely long charged wire, the field is:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = λ / (2π ε<sub>0</sub> r)
        </p>
        <p>
            where <em>λ</em> is the linear charge density.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Planar Symmetry</h4>
        <p>
            For an infinite plane of charge, the field is:
        </p>
        <p>
            E = σ / (2 ε<sub>0</sub>)
        </p>
        <p>
            where <em>σ</em> is the surface charge density.
        </p>

        <h3>Electric Flux</h3>
        <p>
            Electric flux represents the total field passing through a surface:
        </p>
        <p>
            Φ = ∮ E · dA
        </p>
        <p>
            The flux depends on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The field strength.</li>
            <li>The orientation of the surface relative to the field.</li>
            <li>The area of the surface.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advanced Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conductors:</strong> Inside a conductor, the electric field is zero, and excess charge resides
                on the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Insulators:</strong> Charge distribution is fixed, and the field depends on the permittivity of
                the material.</li>
            <li><strong>Faraday Cages:</strong> Use Gauss's Theorem to show that the field inside a closed conductor is
                zero.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 1:</strong> Calculate the field outside and inside a uniformly charged spherical shell using
            Gauss's Theorem.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 2:</strong> Derive the electric field due to an infinite plane of charge.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 3:</strong> Determine the field due to an infinitely long charged cylinder.
